# BF3 AntiCheat System 🛡️

Welcome to the BF3 AntiCheat System repository! This project aims to enhance the security of BF3 servers by implementing a robust anti-cheat mechanism. Currently, it focuses on detecting cheats by monitoring the process count of `lanbf3`. If more than 112 processes are detected, the system will automatically close `lanbf3` to prevent potential cheating.

## Features 🌟

- **Process Monitoring**: Automatically checks for excessive `lanbf3` processes and closes them if detected.
- **Future Enhancements**: Plans to expand detection capabilities to include macros and other types of cheats by scanning for cheat software or services on the client computer.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the BF3 AntiCheat System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Compile **: You must be sure of use Server version and database BF3-PORTABLE-08-2021 
3. **ADVISE **: If you use other BF3 Server just modify the MysqConnector.cs to the database server and tables
4. **Run the AntiCheat System**: Start the anti-cheat system on your server. It will begin monitoring for cheats and automatically take action if any are detected.
